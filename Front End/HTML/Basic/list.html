	The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce risk whenever there are chances of it. For a beginner, a few of these will not be completely applicable. But as a hard-boiled programmer writing numerous codes, all these guidelines will come in handy. Since codes can run up to millions of lines at times, outdated advice like â€˜keep it simple  or less is more is priceless and should always be remembered
